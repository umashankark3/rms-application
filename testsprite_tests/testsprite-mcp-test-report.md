## Test Coverage Analysis

The automated tests covered the following critical user journeys:
- ‚úÖ **Planned:** User authentication flows
- ‚úÖ **Planned:** File management operations
- ‚úÖ **Planned:** Role-based access control
- ‚úÖ **Planned:** Mobile responsiveness
- ‚úÖ **Planned:** UI/UX features (dark mode)
- ‚úÖ **Planned:** Admin functionality
- ‚úÖ **Planned:** Error handling scenarios

**Note:** All planned test scenarios were appropriate and covered the most critical application functionality.

## Conclusion

The RMS application is currently in a **non-functional state** with critical systems failing. The 0% pass rate indicates fundamental issues that prevent basic application usage. **Immediate intervention is required** to restore basic functionality before the application can be considered ready for users.

**Recommendation:** Halt production deployment until critical issues are resolved and tests show significant improvement.
